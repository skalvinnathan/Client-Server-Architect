# Client-Server-Architect
In computer networks server is someone who runs a server programs which
share their resources with client. A client does not share any of its resources, but it
requests content or service form a server. Client, therefore, initiate communication
sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Client’s and servers are core of
world wide web. Client and server exchange messages in a request-response messaging
pattern.The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of
messages is an example of inter-process communication.Communication between nodes
in network is contolled by various protocols.Client,server can communicate either over
tcp (transmission control protocol) or udp (user datagram protocol).udp is a stateless
protocol and dosen’t guarantee the delivery of packets to their destination.Where as tcp
guarantees the delivery of packets.Tcp connections are initiated with a three way
handshake.On the whole Client/server systems have become the computing and
application architecture for business organizations across the globe. Speaking in
technical terms, a client/server system puts application processing close to the user;
helping improve the performance.
